# Train Booking Project

Welcome to the Train Booking project repository! This repository contains the source code and database design for a train booking application built using Java GUI in NetBeans. This ReadMe file will guide you through the project's functionalities, installation process, and usage instructions.

## Functionalities

The Train Booking application provides the following functionalities:

1. **Signing up a new user**: Users can create a new account by providing necessary details such as username, password, and user type (e.g., admin, student).

2. **Updating a user's details**: Existing users can update their personal information, including username, password, and contact information.

3. **Adding a book** (by admin): Administrators have the privilege to add new books to the system by entering relevant details such as book title, author, ISBN, publication year, and other pertinent information.

4. **Updating book details** (by admin): Administrators can modify the details of existing books in the system, including title, author, ISBN, publication year, and other attributes.

5. **Browsing books**: Both administrators and students can browse the available books in the system. They can view the book details such as title, author, ISBN, publication year, and other relevant information.

6. **Showing a list of books that satisfy certain criteria**: Users can search for books that meet specific criteria, such as ISBN, publication year, author, or any other defined criteria.

## Database Design

The database design for this project includes a conceptual ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram), a physical ERD, and the corresponding SQL code generated from the ERD. These components help in understanding the structure and relationships of the database entities.

1. **Conceptual ERD**: The conceptual ERD provides a high-level representation of the database structure, illustrating the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

2. **Physical ERD**: The physical ERD presents a detailed view of the database design, including the table schemas, primary and foreign key relationships, and other relevant constraints.

3. **SQL Code**: The generated SQL code represents the database schema and can be used to create the necessary tables, constraints, and relationships in a database management system.

## Installation and Usage
